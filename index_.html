    This page is about Irish Terriers.
    <p>
        The Irish Terrier is a medium-sized terrier breed from Ireland known for their lively and intelligent
        personalities. One of the oldest terrier breeds, they were once described as the “poor man’s sentinel, the
        farmer’s friend, and the gentleman’s favorite.” Rugged and stouthearted, these Irish dogs have the
        advantages of a convenient size and versatile abilities as a companion and watchdog. <br>Regarding temperament,
        Irish Terriers are affectionate toward their human companions. However, they may prefer to be the solo pet in
        the home. Early socialization can help them warm up to other dogs and pets. The Irish Terrier also has high
        energy and will need a good amount of exercise. Apartment dwellers and those who are away from home for long
        hours of the day may have a hard time meeting the Irish Terrier’s physical needs. You may want to keep this in
        mind if you’re a future pet parent with a busy schedule thinking of adding an Irish Terrier puppy to your home.
        But if you can provide plenty of attention, patience, and space to move, you’ll have a loving, lifelong
        companion.
